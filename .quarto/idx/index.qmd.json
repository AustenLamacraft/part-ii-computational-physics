Setup. Running Python. Notebooks. Language overview\n2. Representation of numbers and floating point\n3. Numpy. Use for simple numerics. Plotting. Dealing with data\n4. Numerical algos. SciPy\n5. Other libraries. Pandas and scikit-learn. Kaggle\n6. Algorithms and complexity. Simple Examples. FFT? Importance of...(see https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/814652). Matrix multiplication. Strassen and Alpha Tensor. Nice discussion in Nature of Computation\n7. Types of algorithm e.g. divide and conquer, dynamic programming (at level of grokking algos book). Recursion. \n8. Random algorithms e.g. Monte Carlo. Inference.\n9. Fun. Machine learning. Diffusion models\n10. Software engineering principles. Version control. Tests\n11. Acceleration. Numba, CuPy, etc.\n\nTrebst's applications:\nODE, Monte Carlo simulation, data analysis, QM scattering, Linear algebra, Neural Nets\n\nRefer to French book for more examples.\n\nPCA as application of linear algebra and quantum mechanics\n\nRandom matrix theory\nLinear regression\n\nLinear programming.\n\nFFT invented before Fourier\n\nGarth Wells has nice material about algos and complexity\nhttps://github.com/CambridgeEngineering/PartIA-Computing-Michaelmas/\n\nHashing\n\n\nNumpy. Basics of ufuncs and vectorization \n2. Loading and saving data\n3. Data types. Floating point. Machine precision\n4. Implementing algos using vectorization (ODEs)\n5. Numerical techniques: ODS, optimization\n6. Computational complexity\n\t1. Complexity of simple algos. Division algorithm as binary search (Ryan O'Donnell tweet)\n\t2. Euler algorithm\n\t3. Complexity of linear algebra operations. Matrix-matrix and matrix-vector. Solving equations can be easier if matrices have structure see e.g. https://martin-thoma.com/solving-equations-of-upper-triangular-matrices/. This is forward   / backward substitution. \n\t4. Strategies: divide and conquer (examples: exponentiation, Strassen, FFT)\n\t5. Monte Carlo and probabilistic methods\n\t6. Dynamic programming\n7. Version control. GitHub. Pull requests. Code review. Look up some code in `scipy`\n\nA note about the format of the notes. Each chapter should be thought of as a notebook, so you'll only see `import numpy as np` once in each chapter, for example. \n\n## Schedule\n\nThe course of eight Lectures will take place at 10:00 on Mondays and Fridays in the Pippard Lecture Theatre.\n\n- First lecture: Monday 23th January\n- Last lecture: Friday 17th February\n- First assignment: Friday 17th February – Friday 24th February\n- Second assignment: Friday 24th February – Friday 3rd March\n- Third assignment: Friday 3rd March – Friday 10th March\n- Fourth assignment: Friday 10th March – Friday 17th March (last day of full Lent term)"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.280","bibliography":["references.bib"],"theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","output-file":"index.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"documentclass":"scrreprt"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
