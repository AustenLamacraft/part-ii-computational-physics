# Big questions...

---

- Are physical processes _really_ the same things as computations?

- Are all processes that happen in the physical universe computable _in principal_ (perhaps on a quantum computer)? 

- This is the [(physical) Church–Turing thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis#Variations)

---

- What computations can we do with finite resources including time and space (memory)

- How _hard_ — or _complex_ — are the computational tasks we wish to perform? Can we quantify this?

---

- You know many _mathematical problems_ that arise in the course of doing physics (e.g. solving a differential equation)

- How can we solve these problems in an efficient way on a computer in situations where no analytic solution is available?

---

- How to represent and operate on the kind of data we encounter in physics (trajectories $\mathbf{x}(t)$, fields $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r},t)$, etc.)?

---

- How do I start Python?

---

## Goals

In this course you will learn

1. About the Python scientific stack (based on NumPy)
2. Its use in implementing some common algorithms in computational physics.
3. Basic ideas of computational complexity used in the analysis of algorithms

- Each exercise should only take you a few hours.

---

## Schedule

# Getting going

---

## Finding your way

- Everyone finds their own workflow for coding (language, editor, etc.)

- This is a roundup of some popular tools in the Python ecosystem

---

## Your coding environment

- You will need to install the Python language (or run online)

- I recommend the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)

-  Comes with all parts of the toolkit we'll need such as [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and the major libraries [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [SciPy](https://scipy.org/)

---

- Try running `python` at the command line

- You should get something like

```
Python 3.9.12 (main, Apr  5 2022, 01:53:17) 
[Clang 12.0.0 ] :: Anaconda, Inc. on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
```

- Confirm you are using Python 3 (the command `python3` will also work and guarantee this if you happen to have Python 2 as the default)

---

- Prompt `>>>` indicates that you have started the Python interactive shell or [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) and are good to go:  

```{python}
#| echo: true
print("Hello world!")
1 + 2
```

- To leave and return to command line, run `quit()` or `exit()`

## IPython

- If you the above with `python` nice colour scheme is absent

- This is called [syntax highlighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting) and provides a visual guide to the syntax of the language.

- [IPython](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is an interactive shell that provides syntax highlighting and much more

- If you have installed IPython (it comes with Anaconda) you can start it from the command line with `ipython`

---

## Helpful features of IPython: 

- Tab completion: hit `tab` to autocomplete. Particularly useful for viewing all properties or methods of an object:

![](assets/tab-complete.gif){.border}

- Typing `?obj` or `obj?` prints detailed information about the object `obj` (`??` provides additional detail). 

---

-  _Magic commands_ prefixed by `%` provide additional functionality

- `%timeit` finds the executation time of a single line statement, which is useful when profiling the performance of code:
```{python}
#| echo: true
%timeit L = [n ** 2 for n in range(1000)]
```

- `%timeit` automatically runs several times to give statistics on execution time. For multiple lines you can use the `%%timeit` magic.

- Much more in the [IPython documentation](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

---

## Running a Python program 

- Python code in a file with a `.py` extension can be run from the command line with 
```
python hello_world.py
```
  or 

```
python -m hello_world
``` 

- In the latter case `-m` option tells interpreter to look for a _module_ called `hello_world`

- From the IPython shell you can instead use 

```python
run hello_world.py
```
or just 

```python
run hello_world
```


## Importing code

- A Python [module](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) is a file containing definition and statements

- Breaking long code into modules is good practice for writing clear and reusable software

- Users may not want to see the details of a function in order to be able to us it

---

- If I make the file `hello_world.py` containing the function:

```{python}
#| echo: true
def hello():
    print("Hello world!")
```

- I can run this function by first importing the module:

```{python}
#| echo: true
import hello_world
hello_world.hello()
```

- The function `hello` is accessed from the `hello_world` _namespace_

- This is to avoid confusion if more than one imported module has a function of the same name

---

- If you are confident this is not an issue and want more concise code you can do this:

```{python}
#| echo: true
from hello_world import hello
hello()
```

- or even:

```{python}
#| echo: true
from hello_world import *
hello()
```

- The issue with the latter is that it may introduce a whole bunch of names that can interfere with things you already defined

---

## Packages

- A collection of modules in a folder is called a _package_

- You can import a package in the same way and access all the modules using the same `.` notation i.e. `package.module1`, `package.module2`, etc..

- Since explicit namespaces are preferred to avoid ambiguity use shorthands for the package or module you are importing: 

```{python}
#| echo: true
import numpy as np
np.arange(10)
```

- (You can call it what you like, of course!) 


## Installing libraries

- 99% of the code you run will have been written by somebody else in the form of a library 

- Package installation is handled by the command line utilities `pip` or `conda`, the latter being the package manager for the Anaconda distribution

- If you have NumPy and SciPy installed you won't need to worry about this too much

## Editors

- Modern editors come with a huge number of tools that make writing code much easier

- Syntax highlighting, code completion, parameter information and documentation popups as you type

- These go under the general heading [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense)

- The latest hotness is [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot): AI code suggestions

- (imo) these are all part of a continuum of productivity enhancements that enable people to write better code faster. Try them out!

- I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Notebooks

- Software developers write `.py` files, modules and packages

- Scientists and others doing more exploratory work tend to favour a Notebook format that mixes code, text, and plots

- Dominant option is [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which comes with the Anaconda distribution

- Start from command line with `jupyter notebook` (or from the Anaconda Navigator application)

- Opens a notebook as a web page in your browser, where it can be edited and saved. The default extension is `.ipynb`

---

- Jupyter notebooks can run code in different languages, but the default process is IPython

- Text cells can be formatted using [Markdown](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html) and also support $\LaTeX$ equations, which is pretty handy for us

- Google has their own cloud version of the Jupyter notebook called [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

- Try it out for free, though you have to pay for significant compute

- The "next generation" of the Jupyter notebook is called JupyterLab and can be started with `jupyter lab`

- Notebook files can be opened in either Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook
