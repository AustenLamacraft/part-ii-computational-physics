# NumPy and friends

```{python}
#| echo: true
import numpy as np
```
---

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) package is _the_ key building block of the Python scientific ecosystem.

- __Assume that what you want to achieve _can_ be achieved in a highly optimised way within the existing framework__

- Only resort to your own solution if this is not the case

- Many resources for learning NumPy online (see links in notes)

## Preamble: objects in Python

- Everything in Python is an _object_

- For example `[1,2,3]` is a `list`:

```{python}
#| echo: true
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
type(my_list)
```

- Object is container for _properties_ and _methods_ (functions associated with object), accessed with `.` syntax.

- e.g. lists have `append` method:

```{python}
#| echo: true
my_list.append("boop")
my_list
```

---

- In IPython you can see all the available methods by hitting tab:

![](../assets/tab-complete-slow.gif)

---

- List all of an objects properties and methods using `dir`:

```{python}
#| echo: true
print(dir(my_list))
```

- Many are _dunder methods_ (or _magic methods_, or just _special methods_), to be used by Python interpreter to implement certain standard functions

---

- e.g. `len(my_list)` is actually calling `my_list.__len__` which does job of actually finding length.

```{python}
#| echo: true
my_list.__len__()
```

- Example of [polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)) in object oriented programming

## Arrays

- Fundamental object in NumPy is _Array_ (or `ndarray`), multidimensional version of a `list`

- In plain old Python a matrix would be a list of lists.

```{python}
#| echo: true
data = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]
```

-  `data[i]` represents each row:

```{python}
#| echo: true
data[1]
```

---

- To multiply every element by a number I would do something like this:

```{python}
#| echo: true
for row in data:
    for j, _ in enumerate(row):
        row[j] *= 2
data
```

::: incremental
-  ___Don't do this___
- NumPy is made for tasks like this with _minimum code_ and _maximum efficiency_
:::

---

- First create data as array

- Numerous NumPy functions produce arrays

- Simplest is [numpy.array](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.array.html#numpy.array): takes data in "Pythonic" list-of-lists(-of-lists-of... etc.) form and produces `ndarray`

```{python}
#| echo: true
my_array = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]])
type(my_array)
```

---

- Multiply array by number? Easy!

```{python}
#| echo: true
2 * my_array
```

- It even prints nicely

```{python}
#| echo: true
print(my_array)
```

## Indexing

```{python}
#| echo: true
my_array
```

- Arrays can be indexed, similar to lists

```{python}
#| echo: true
print(my_array[0], my_array[1], my_array[3][1])
```

- Better syntax for the last one

```{python}
#| echo: true
my_array[3,1]
```

---

```{python}
#| echo: true
my_array
```

- Also have a generalization of the _slice_ syntax 

```{python}
#| echo: true
my_array[1:, 1:]
```

- Slicing can be mixed with integer indexing

```{python}
#| echo: true
my_array[1:, 1]
```

---

- NumPy has all sorts of fancy indexing options 

- Indexing with integer arrays, with boolean arrays, etc.

- See the [documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.indexing.html)

## Shape

- A fundamental property of an array is `shape`:

```{python}
#| echo: true
# [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]
my_array.shape
```

:::incremental
- First a number of `[` corresponding to the __rank__ of the array (two in the above example)

- Then number of entries giving rightmost (innermost) dimension in shape before closing `]` (3 here)

- After a number of 1D arrays `[...]` equal to the next innermost dimension (4 here), we have another closing `]`, and so on
  
:::

---

- Slicing does not change the array rank

```{python}
#| echo: true
my_array[1:, 1:].shape
```

- Integer indexing does

```{python}
#| echo: true
my_array[1:, 1].shape
```

- __Note:__ `(3,)` is _tuple_ giving the shape while `(3)` is just the number 3 in brackets

## Lots of methods to create arrays

```{python}
#| echo: true
a = np.zeros((2,2))
print(a)
b = np.ones((2,2))
print(b)
c = np.full((2,2), 5)
print(c)
d = np.random.random((2,2)) # random numbers uniformly in [0.0, 1.0)
print(d)
eye = np.eye(2) # Identity matrix
print(eye)
```

## Shape shifting

- [numpy.reshape](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html#numpy-reshape) to change the shape of an array

- [numpy.expand_dims](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.expand_dims.html) to insert new axes of length one.

- [numpy.squeeze](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.squeeze.html#numpy.squeeze) (the opposite) to remove new axes of length one.

---

- Example of `reshape`

```{python}
#| echo: true
my_array.reshape(2, 2, 3)
```

- Only works if the shapes are compatible. Here it's OK because the original shape was $(4,3)$ and $4\times 3 = 2\times 2\times 3$

- If shapes aren't compatible, we'll get an error

```{python}
#| error: true
#| echo: true
my_array.reshape(2, 3, 3)
```

## `dtype`

- Arrays have `dtype` property that gives datatype

- If array was created from data, this will be inferred

```{python}
#| echo: true
my_array.dtype
```

- Functions constructing arrays have optional `dtype`

```{python}
#| echo: true
my_float_array = np.array([1,2,3], dtype=np.float64)
my_float_array.dtype
```

- Importantly, complex numbers are supported

```{python}
#| echo: true
my_float_array = np.array([1.1 + 2.3j,2.2,3.6])
my_float_array.dtype
```

## Examples of array-like data

- Position, velocity, or acceleration of particle will be three dimensional vectors, so have shape `(3,)`

- With $N$ particles could use a $3N$ dimensional vector

- Better: an array of shape `(N,3)`. First index indexes particle number and second particle coordinate.

- $N\times M$ matrix has shape `(N,M)`

- Riemann curvature tensor in General Relativity $R_{abcd}$ has shape `(4,4,4,4)`

---

- _Fields_ are functions of space and time e.g. the electric potential $\phi(\mathbf{r},t)$

- Approximate these using a grid of space-time points $N_x\times N_y \times N_z\times N_t$

- Scalar field can be stored in an array of shape `(N_x,N_y,N_z,N_t)`

- A vector field like $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r},t)$ would be `(N_x,N_y,N_z,N_t,3)`

---

- Very useful method to create a grid of coordinate values
```{python}
#| echo: true
# Grid of x, y points
nx, ny = 64, 64
x = np.linspace(-2, 2, nx)
y = np.linspace(-2, 2, ny)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
X.shape
```


```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Dipole electric field"
# Example from https://scipython.com/blog/visualizing-a-vector-field-with-matplotlib/
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.patches import Circle

def E(q, r0, x, y):
    """Return the electric field vector E=(Ex,Ey) due to charge q at r0."""
    den = np.hypot(x-r0[0], y-r0[1])**3
    return q * (x - r0[0]) / den, q * (y - r0[1]) / den

# Dipole
charges = [(1, (1, 0)), (-1, (-1, 0))]

# Electric field vector, E=(Ex, Ey), as separate components
Ex, Ey = np.zeros((ny, nx)), np.zeros((ny, nx))
for charge in charges:
    ex, ey = E(*charge, x=X, y=Y)
    Ex += ex
    Ey += ey

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)

# Plot the streamlines with an appropriate arrow style
color = 2 * np.log(np.hypot(Ex, Ey))
ax.streamplot(x, y, Ex, Ey, color=color, linewidth=1,
              density=2, arrowstyle='->', arrowsize=1.5)

# Add filled circles for the charges themselves
charge_colors = {True: '#aa0000', False: '#0000aa'}
for q, pos in charges:
    ax.add_artist(Circle(pos, 0.05, color=charge_colors[q>0]))

ax.set_xlabel('$x$')
ax.set_ylabel('$y$')
ax.set_xlim(-2,2)
ax.set_ylim(-2,2)
ax.set_aspect('equal')
plt.show()
```


## Mathematical operations with arrays

- On lists

```{python}
#| echo: true
2 * [1, 2, 3]
```

- In numerical applications what we really want is

```{python}
#| echo: true
2 * np.array([1, 2, 3])
```

---

- General feature of NumPy: __all mathematical operations are performed elementwise on arrays!__

```{python}
#| echo: true
print(np.array([1, 2, 3]) + np.array([4, 5, 6]))
print(np.array([1, 2, 3])**2)
print(np.sqrt(np.array([1, 2, 3])))
```

- Avoids need to write nested loops

- Loops are still there, but written in C

- This style of code is often described as _vectorized_

- In NumPy-speak vectorized functions are called _ufuncs_

- As a basic principle __never use a Python loop to access your data in NumPy code__

## Broadcasting...

- ...is a powerful protocol for combining arrays of different shapes, generalizing this kind of thing
```{python}
#| echo: true
np.array([1, 2, 3]) + 2.3
```

---

- Elementwise operations performed on two arrays of same rank if in each index sizes _either match or one array has size 1_

```{python}
#| echo: true
# These have shape (2, 3) and (1, 3)
np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]) + np.array([[4, 3, 2]])
```

- We can simplify this last example

```{python}
#| echo: true
# These have shape (2, 3) and (3,)
np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]) + np.array([4, 3, 2])
```

---

- Recall example of an $N$-particle system described by a position array of shape `(N,3)`

- If we want to shift the entire system by a vector, just add a vector of shape `(3,)` and broadcasting will ensure that this applied correctly to each particle.

---

Broadcasting two arrays follows these rules:

1. If arrays do not have same rank, prepend shape of lower rank array with 1s until both shapes have same length

---

2. Two arrays are said to be _compatible_ in a dimension if they have same size in that dimension, or if one of the arrays has size 1 in that dimension

---

3. Arrays can be broadcast together if they are compatible in all dimensions.
After broadcasting, each array behaves as if it had shape equal to the elementwise maximum of shapes of the two input arrays

---

4. In any dimension where one array had size 1 and the other array had size greater than 1, the first array behaves as if it were copied along that dimension

:::incremental

- [The documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html) has more detail

- Broadcasting takes some time to get used to but is immensely powerful!

## Plotting with Matplotlib

 - Various specialized Python plotting libraries 
 
 - "entry-level" option is [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
 
 - `pyplot` module provides a plotting system that is similar to MATLAB (I'm told)

```{python}
#| echo: true
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

- Probably the second most common import you will make!

---

- Here's a simple example of `plot` function

```{python}
#| echo: true
# Compute the x and y coordinates for points on a sine curve
x = np.arange(0, 3 * np.pi, 0.1)
y = np.sin(x)

# Plot the points using matplotlib
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```

- __Note__: you must call plt.show() to make graphics appear

---

- Fancier example with some labelling

```python
# Compute the x and y coordinates for points on sine and cosine curves
x = np.arange(0, 3 * np.pi, 0.1)
y_sin = np.sin(x)
y_cos = np.cos(x)

# Plot the points using matplotlib
plt.plot(x, y_sin)
plt.plot(x, y_cos)
plt.xlabel('x axis label')
plt.ylabel('y axis label')
plt.title('Sine and Cosine')
plt.legend(['Sine', 'Cosine'])
plt.show()
```

---

```{python}
# Compute the x and y coordinates for points on sine and cosine curves
x = np.arange(0, 3 * np.pi, 0.1)
y_sin = np.sin(x)
y_cos = np.cos(x)

# Plot the points using matplotlib
plt.plot(x, y_sin)
plt.plot(x, y_cos)
plt.xlabel('x axis label')
plt.ylabel('y axis label')
plt.title('Sine and Cosine')
plt.legend(['Sine', 'Cosine'])
plt.show()
```


---

- Often you'll want to make several related plots and present them together

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Compute the x and y coordinates for points on sine and cosine curves
x = np.arange(0, 3 * np.pi, 0.1)
y_sin = np.sin(x)
y_cos = np.cos(x)

# Set up a subplot grid that has height 2 and width 1,
# and set the first such subplot as active.
plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)

# Make the first plot
plt.plot(x, y_sin)
plt.title('Sine')

# Set the second subplot as active, and make the second plot.
plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)
plt.plot(x, y_cos)
plt.title('Cosine')

# Show the figure.
plt.show()
```

---
```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Compute the x and y coordinates for points on sine and cosine curves
x = np.arange(0, 3 * np.pi, 0.1)
y_sin = np.sin(x)
y_cos = np.cos(x)

# Set up a subplot grid that has height 2 and width 1,
# and set the first such subplot as active.
plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)

# Make the first plot
plt.plot(x, y_sin)
plt.title('Sine')

# Set the second subplot as active, and make the second plot.
plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)
plt.plot(x, y_cos)
plt.title('Cosine')

# Show the figure.
plt.show()
```

## Example: playing with images

- Pixels in an image encoded as a triple of RGB values in the range [0,255] i.e. 8 bits of type `uint8` (the "u" is for "unsigned")

- Tinting an image gives a nice example of broadcasting

---

```python
img = plt.imread('../assets/lucian.jpeg')

img_tinted = img * [1, 0.55, 1]

# Show the original image
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.imshow(img)
plt.title("Lucian")

# Show the tinted image
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.title("Pink Panther")
# Having multiplied by floats, 
# we must cast the image to uint8 before displaying it.
plt.imshow(np.uint8(img_tinted))

plt.show()
img.shape, img.dtype
```

---

```{python}
img = plt.imread('../assets/lucian.jpeg')

img_tinted = img * [1, 0.55, 1]

# Show the original image
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.imshow(img)
plt.title("Lucian")

# Show the tinted image
plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.title("Pink Panther")
# Having multiplied by floats, 
# we must cast the image to uint8 before displaying it.
plt.imshow(np.uint8(img_tinted))

plt.show()
img.shape, img.dtype
```

This is a standard 12 megapixel image

## Saving and loading data

- At some point you'll probably want to save and load data

- NumPy comes with its own [save](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.save.html) and [load](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.load.html) functions and associated binary format `.npy`

- The benefit of using these is that after loading you get back a NumPy array ready to be used

---

- A related function [savez](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.savez.html) allows several arrays to be saved and then loaded as a dictionary-like object.

```{python}
#| echo: true
random_matrix_1 = np.random.rand(4, 4)
random_matrix_2 = np.random.rand(4, 4)
np.savez("../assets/my-matrices", first_matrix=random_matrix_1, second_matrix=random_matrix_2)
%ls ../assets
```

---

```{python}
#| echo: true
my_matrix_file = np.load("../assets/my-matrices.npz")
my_matrix_file['first_matrix']
```
