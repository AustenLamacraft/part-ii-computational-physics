# Floating point and ODEs

---


```{python}
#| echo: true
0.1  + 0.2 == 0.3
```

- What's going on?

## Integers

 - Something simpler

```{python}
#| echo: true
1 + 1 == 2
```

- Integers can be represented in binary

```{python}
#| echo: true
3 == 0b11 # Ooctal `0o` or hexadecimal `0h`
```
    
- Binary string representation using `bin` function

```{python}
#| echo: true
bin(-2)
```

---

- Python allows for arbitrarily large integers

- No possibility of overflow or rounding error

```{python}
#| echo: true
2**100
```

- Only limitation is memory!

---

- Numpy integers are a different story 

```{python}
#| error: true
#| echo: true
import numpy as np
np.int64(2**100)
```

- Since NumPy is using C the types have to play nicely

- Range of integers that represented with 32 bit `numpy.int32`s is $\approx\pm 2^{31} \approx \pm 2.1 × 10^9$ (one bit for sign) 

- 64 bit `numpy.int64`s lie in range $\approx\pm 2^{63} \approx \pm 9.2 × 10^{18}$

- Apart from the risk of overflow when working NumPy's integers there are no other gotchas to worry about


## Floating point numbers

- $0.1 + 0.2 \neq 0.3$ in Python is that __specifying a real number exactly would involve an infinite number of bits__

- Any finite representation necessarily approximate

- Representation for reals is called [floating point arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic)

- Essentially scientific notation

$$\text{significand}  \times \text{exponent}
$$

- Named _floating point_ because number of digits after decimal point not fixed 

---

- Requires choice of base, and Python's floating point numbers use binary

- _Numbers with finite binary representations behave nicely_

```{python}
#| echo: true
0.125 + 0.25 == 0.375
```

- For decimal numbers to be represented exactly we'd have to use base ten. Can be achieved with `decimal` module:

```{python}
#| echo: true
from decimal import *
Decimal('0.1') + Decimal('0.2')
```

- But: there's nothing to single out decimal representation in physics (as opposed to, say, finance)

---

$$
(-1)^s\times c \times b^q
$$

- A specification for floating point numbers must give

    1. Base (or _radix_) $b$
    2. Precision $p$, the number of digits in the significand $c$. Thus $0\leq c \leq b^{p}-1$.
    3. A range of exponents $q$ specifed by $\text{emin}$ and $\text{emax}$ with $\text{emin}\leq q+p-1 \leq \text{emax}$.
    4. One bit $s$ for overall sign

<!-- - One bit $s$ for overall sign, a number then has form $(-1)^s\times c \times b^q$.  -->

- Smallest positive nonzero number that can be represented is $b^{1 + \text{emin} - p}$ (corresponding to the smallest value of the exponent) and largest is $b^{1 + \text{emax}} - 1$. 

---

$$
(-1)^s\times c \times b^q
$$

- Representation isn't unique: (sometimes) could make significand smaller and exponent bigger

- A unique representation is fixed by choosing the exponent to be as small as possible.

- Representing numbers smaller than $b^{\text{emin}}$ involves a loss of precision, as number of digits in significand $<p$ and exponent takes its minimum value ([subnormal numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnormal_number))

- If we stick with normal numbers and a $p$-bit significand, leading bit will be 1 and so can be dropped from the representation: only requires $p-1$ bits.    

---
 
- Specification for floating point numbers used by Python (and many other languages) is contained in the IEEE Standard for Floating Point Arithmetic [IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754)

- Default Python `float` uses 64 bit _binary64_ representation (often called _double precision_)

- Here's how those 64 bits are used:

    - $p=53$ for the significand, encoded in 52 bits
    - 11 bits for the exponent
    - 1 bit for the sign

---

- Another common representation is 32 bit _binary32_ (_single precision_) with:

    - $p=24$ for the significand, encoded in 23 bits
    - 8 bits for the exponent
    - 1 bit for the sign


## Floating point numbers in NumPy {#sec-fp-numpy}

- NumPy's [finfo](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.finfo.html) function tells all [machine precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_epsilon)

```{python}
#| echo: true
np.finfo(np.float64)
```

- Note that $2^{-52}=2.22\times 10^{-16}$ which accounts for resolution $10^{-15}$

- This can be checked by finding when a number is close enough to treated as 1.0.

```{python}
#| echo: true
x=1.0
while 1.0 + x != 1.0:
    x /= 1.01 
print(x)
```

---

- For binary32 we have a resolution of $10^{-6}$.

```{python}
#| echo: true
np.finfo(np.float32)
```

---

- Taking small differences between numbers is a potential source of rounding error

![](../assets/ia-question.png)

- Solution: $x-x'=x(1-\gamma^{-1})\sim x\beta^2/2\sim 4.2\text{mm}$. 

```{python}
#| echo: true
import numpy as np
from scipy.constants import c
beta = 384400e3 / (76 * 3600) / c
gamma = 1/np.sqrt(1 - beta**2)
print(1 - np.float32(1/gamma), 1 - np.float64(1/gamma))
```


## The dreaded NaN

- As well as a floating point system, IEEE 754 defines `Infinity` and `NaN` (Not a Number)

```{python}
#| echo: true
np.array([1, -1, 0]) / 0
```

- They behave as you might guess

```{python}
#| echo: true
2 * np.inf, 0 * np.inf, np.inf > np.nan
```

---

- NaNs propagate through subsequent operations

```{python}
#| echo: true
2 * np.nan
```

- If you get a NaN somewhere in your calculation, you'll probably end up seeing it somewhere in the output

# Differential equations with SciPy

---

> Newton's fundamental discovery, the one which he considered necessary to keep secret and published only in the form of an anagram, consists of the following: _Data aequatione quotcunque fluentes quantitates involvente, fluxiones invenire; et vice versa_. In contemporary mathematical language, this means: "It is useful to solve differential equations".
>
>Vladimir Arnold, _Geometrical Methods in the Theory of Ordinary Differential Equations_

---

- Solving differential equations is _not possible in general_

$$
\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x, t)
$$

- Cannot be solved for general $f(x,t)$ 

- Formulating a system in terms of differential equations represents an important first step

- Numerical analysis of differential equations is a colossal topic in applied mathematics

- Important thing is to access existing solvers (and implement your own if necessary) and to _understand their limitations_

---

- Basic idea is to _discretize_ equation and solution $x_j\equiv x(t_j)$ at time points $t_j = hj$ with some _step size_ $h$

![Taraji P. Henson as Katherine Johnson in _Hidden Figures_](../assets/Hidden-Figures-scene_Katherine-Johnson-calculates-orbital-insertion-trajectories_Credit_TM-and-C-2017-Twentieth-Century-Fox-Film-Corporation_All-rights-reserved.webp){fig-align="center" width="700"}

---

## Euler's method

$$
\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x, t)
$$

- Simplest approach: approximate LHS of ODE

$$
\frac{dx}{dt}\Bigg|_{t=t_j} \approx \frac{x_{j+1} - x_j}{h}
$$ 

$$
x_{j+1} = x_j + hf(x_j, t_j)
$$

---

$$
x_{j+1} = x_j + hf(x_j, t_j)
$$

- Once _initial condition_ $x_0$ is specified, subsequent values obtained by iteration

---

$$
\frac{dx}{dt}\Bigg|_{t=t_j} \approx \frac{x_{j+1} - x_j}{h}
$$ 

- [forward finite difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference): why?

- So that update rule is _explicit_ formula for $x_{j+1}$ in terms of $x_j$

- If we had used backward derivative we would end up with [backward Euler method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_Euler_method)
$$
x_{j+1} = x_j + hf(x_{j+1}, t_{j+1})
$$
which is _implicit_

--- 

- This means that the update requires an additional step to numerically solve for $x_{j+1}$

- Although this is more costly, there are benefits to the backward method associated with stability (as we'll see)

---

### Truncation error

- In Euler scheme we make an $O(h^2)$ _local truncation error_

- To integrate for a fixed time number of steps required is proportional to $h^{-1}$

- The worst case error at fixed time (the _global truncation error_) is $O(h)$

- For this reason Euler's method is _first order_

- More sophisticated methods typically higher order: the SciPy function [scipy.integrate.solve_ivp](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html#r179348322575-1) uses fifth order method by default

---

### Midpoint method

- [Midpoint method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midpoint_method) is a simple example of a higher order integration scheme

$$
\begin{align}
k_1 &\equiv h f(x_j,t_j) \\
k_2 &\equiv h f(x_i + k_1/2, t_j + h/2) \\
x_{j+1} &= x_j + k_2 +O(h^3)
\end{align}
$$

- $O(h^2)$ error cancels! 

- Downside is that we have two function evaluations to perform per step, but this is often worthwhile

---

### Rounding error

- More computer time $\longrightarrow$ smaller $h$ $\longrightarrow$ better accuracy?

- This ignores machine precision $\epsilon$

- Rounding error is roughly $\epsilon x_j$

- If $N\propto h^{-1}$ errors in successive steps treated as independent random variables, relative total rounding error will be $\propto \sqrt{N}\epsilon=\frac{\epsilon}{\sqrt{h}}$

- Will dominate for $h$ small

---

### Stability

- Euler method may be unstable, depending on equation

- Simple example:

$$
\frac{dx}{dt} = kx
$$

---

```{python}
#| echo: true
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def euler(h, t_max, k=1):
    """
    Solve the equation x' = k x, with x(0) = 1 using
    the Euler method. 

    Integrate from t=0 to t=t_max using stepsize h for
    num_steps = t_max / h.
    
    Returns two arrays of length num_steps: t, the time coordinate, and x_0, the position.
    """
    num_steps = int(t_max / h)
    # Allocate return arrays
    x = np.zeros(num_steps, dtype=np.float32)
    t = np.zeros(num_steps, dtype=np.float32)
    x[0] = 1.0  # Initial condition
    for i in range(num_steps - 1):
        x[i+1] = x[i] + k * x[i] * h
        t[i+1] = t[i] + h  # Time step
    return t, x
```

---

```{python}
k = -2.3
t_max = 5
t, x = euler(1, t_max, k)
plt.plot(t, x, label="h=1 Euler")
t, x = euler(0.7, t_max, k)
plt.plot(t, x, label="h=0.7 Euler")
t = np.linspace(0, t_max, 100)
plt.plot(t, np.exp(k * t), label="exact solution")
plt.title("k=-2.3")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

---

- For a linear equation Euler update is a simple rescaling

$$
x_{j+1} = x_j(1 + hk)
$$

- Region of stability is $|1 + hk|\leq 1$

- You can check that backward Euler method eliminates the instability for $k<0$.

---

## Using SciPy

- Coming up with integration schemes is best left to the professionals

- Try [integrate](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/integrate.html) module of the [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) library

- [scipy.integrate.solve_ivp](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html#r179348322575-1) provides a versatile API

---

### Reduction to first order system

- All these integration schemes apply to systems of _first order_ differential equations

- Higher order equations can always be presented as a first order system

---

- We are often concerned with Newton's equation 

$$
m\frac{d^2 \mathbf{x}}{dt^2} = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)
$$
which is three second order equations

- Turn this into a first order system by introducing the velocity $\mathbf{v}=\dot{\mathbf{x}}$, giving six equations

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt} &= \mathbf{v}\\
m\frac{d \mathbf{v}}{dt} &= \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)
\end{align}
$$

---

- Pendulum equation

$$
\ddot \theta = -\sin\theta
$$
which can be cast as

$$
\begin{align}
\dot\theta &= l\\
\dot l &= -\sin\theta
\end{align}
$$

- Solving using SciPy requires defining a function giving RHS

```{python}
#| echo: true
def pendulum(t, y): return [y[1], -np.sin(y[0])]
# The pendulum equation: y[0] is theta and y[1] is l
```

---

Then call `solve_ivp`

```{python}
#| echo: true
from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

t_max = 1000
pendulum_motion = solve_ivp(pendulum, [0, t_max], [2, 0], dense_output=True)
```

- Option `dense_output=True` specifies that a continuous solution should be found

-  Returned object `pendulum_motion` has `sol` property that is an instance of [OdeSolution](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.OdeSolution.html#scipy.integrate.OdeSolution). `sol(t)` returns the computed solution at $t$ (this involves interpolation)

---

- Use this to plot pendulum's trajectory in $\theta- l$ [phase plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_plane), along with contours of conserved energy function

$$
E(\theta, l) = \frac{1}{2}l^2 - \cos\theta
$$

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Code for plot"
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

theta = np.linspace(-1.1 * np.pi, 1.1 * np.pi, 60)
l = np.linspace(-2, 2, 60)
E = -np.cos(theta[np.newaxis,:]) + (l[:,np.newaxis])**2 / 2
# Note the use of broadcasting to obtain the energy as a function of the phase space coordinates

xx, yy = np.meshgrid(theta, l)

ax.contourf(xx, yy, E, cmap='Reds')
t = np.linspace(0, t_max, 10000)
ax.plot(*pendulum_motion.sol(t))
plt.xlabel(r'$\theta$')
plt.ylabel(r'$l$')
plt.show()
```

Thickness of blue line is due to variation of energy over $t=1000$ trajectory (measured in units where the frequency of linear oscillation is $2\pi$)

---

- We did not have to specify a time step

- This is determined _adaptively_ by solver to keep estimate of local error below `atol + rtol * abs(y)`

- Default values of $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-3}$ respectively

- Monitoring conserved quantities is a good experimental method for assessing the accuracy of integration

--- 

- Alternative `dense_output=True` is to track "events"

- User-defined points of interest on trajectory

- Supply `solve_ivp` with functions `event(t, x)` whose zeros define the events. We can use events to take a "cross section" of higher dimensional motion

---

## [Hénon–Heiles system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A9non%E2%80%93Heiles_system)

- Model chaotic system with origins in stellar dynamics

$$
\begin{align}
\dot x &= p_x \\
\dot p_x &= -x -2\lambda xy \\
\dot y &= p_y \\
\dot p_y &=  - y -\lambda(x^2-y^2).
\end{align}
$$

- Example of [Hamilton's equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_mechanics)

- Phase space is now four dimensional and impossible to visualize. 

---

- Conserved energy is

$$
E = \frac{1}{2}\left(p_x^2+p_y^2 + x^2 + y^2\right) + \lambda\left(x^2y-\frac{1}{3}y^3\right)
$$

- $\lambda=0$ the HH system corresponds to an isotropic 2D harmonic oscillator with conserved angular momentum 

$$
J = x p_y - y p_x
$$

---

- Take [Poincaré section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_map) with $x=0$. A system with energy $E$ must lie within the curve defined by

$$
E = \frac{1}{2}\left(p_y^2 + y^2\right) -\frac{\lambda}{3}y^3
$$

- From $x=0$ generate section of given $E$ by solving for $p_x$

$$
p_x = \sqrt{2E-y^2-p_y^2 + \frac{2\lambda}{3}y^3}
$$

---

```{python}
#| echo: true
def henon_heiles(t, z, 𝜆): 
    x, px, y, py = z
    return [px, -x - 2 * 𝜆 * x * y, py, -y - 𝜆 * (x**2 - y**2)]

def px(E, y, py, 𝜆):
    return np.sqrt(2 * E - y**2 - py**2 + 2 * 𝜆 * y**3 / 3)

def section(t, y, 𝜆): return y[0] # The section with x=0

t_max = 10000
𝜆 = 1
hh_motion = []
for E in [1/10, 1/8, 1/6]:
    hh_motion.append(solve_ivp(henon_heiles, [0, t_max], [0, px(E, 0.1, -0.1, 𝜆), 0.1, -0.1], events=section, args=[𝜆], atol=1e-7, rtol=1e-7))
```

---

- Plot a section of phase space with increasing energy, showing transition from regular to chaotic dynamics

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Code for plot"
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 3)
energies = ["1/10", "1/8", "1/6"]
for idx, data in enumerate(hh_motion): 
        ax[idx].scatter(*data.y_events[0][:, 2:].T, s=0.1)
        ax[idx].title.set_text(f"E={energies[idx]}")        
        ax[idx].set_xlabel(r'$y$')

ax[0].set_ylabel(r'$p_y$')
plt.show()
```
