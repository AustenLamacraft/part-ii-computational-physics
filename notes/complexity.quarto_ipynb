        "\n",
        "When computer scientists talk about the complexity of a problem, this question of _scaling of the number of steps involved_ is what they have in mind. The complexity of any particular task (or calculation) may vary considerably — evaluating $100\\times 100$ is considerably easier than the general case, for example — so instead we ask about how a particular _general_ algorithm performs on a _class_ of tasks. Such a class is what computer scientists mean when they talk about a problem: multiplication of $n$ digit numbers is a _problem_, and any particular pair of $n$ digit numbers represents an _instance_ of that problem. What we discussed above is a particular algorithm for multiplication that has _quadratic complexity_, or \"$O(n^2)$ complexity\" (say \"order $n$ squared\"). \n",
        "\n",
        "This description only keeps track of how the difficulty scales with the size of the problem. There are various reasons why this level of detail is important:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. It allows us to gloss over what exactly we mean by a _step_. Are we working in base ten or binary? Looking the digit multiplications up in a table or doing them from scratch?\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Likewise we don't have to worry about how the algorithm is implemented exactly in software or hardware, what language we use, and so on.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Inevitably, we always want to look at harder and harder problems with bigger and bigger $n$ (whatever $n$ means for the problem at hand). If a simulation finishes for a system of length 10 we immediately want to run it again for length 20, and so on. It then becomes important to know whether our code is going to run for twice as long, four times as long, or $2^{10}$ times as long (exponential scaling).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Best / worst / average\n",
        "\n",
        "Even when we focus on a problem in the above sense we still have to be careful in defining the complexity of an algorithm. In general we can characterize three complexities: best case, worse case, and average case. To see the difference between these three consider _search_, the very simple problem of finding an item in an (unordered) list of length $n$. How hard is this? You have to check every item until you find the one you are looking for, so this suggests the complexity is $O(n)$. You could be lucky and get it first try, however, or within the first ten tries. This means the _best case complexity_ of search is $O(1)$: it doesn't increase with the size of the problem. The worst thing that could happen is that the sought item is last: the _worst case complexity_ is $O(n)$. On average, you'll find your item in the middle of the list on attempt $\\sim n/2$, so the _average case complexity_ is $O(n/2)$. But this is the same as $O(n)$ (constants don't matter)\n",

        "This general approach has been elaborated in many directions. For example, the [Strassen algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strassen_algorithm) is a divide and conquer algorithm for matrix multiplication with complexity $O(n^{\\log_2 7})\\approx O(n^{2.8074})$ that beats the naive $O(n^3)$ method. While these methods have been of great conceptual importance, I understand that practicalities of implementation mean that they aren't in general use in the libraries you are likely to use.\n",
