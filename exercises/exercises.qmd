title: Exercises
---

There are __four computing exercises__ to be completed in the last four weeks of full Lent term; one per week. The exercises count for 0.2 units or further work, or roughly 2% of your final mark for the year. Thus each exercise should only take you a few hours. Each of the four exercises is marked out of 5 for a total of 20 marks. Marks will be awarded in proportion to the amount of each exercise you successfully complete. _Successfully complete_ means that at the very least the relevant code should run!

- First exercise: Friday 17th February – Friday 24th February
- Second exercise: Friday 24th February – Friday 3rd March
- Third exercise: Friday 3rd March – Friday 10th March
- Fourth exercise: Friday 10th March – Friday 17th March (last day of full Lent term)

You will receive a link to the exercise via email on the first day before noon (i.e. Friday 17th February for the first exercise). The deadline for every exercise is __12 noon__ on the final day (i.e. Friday 24th February for the first exercise).

# How to submit

You will be using [GitHub classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) to submit your work, so you will need a GitHub account if you don't already have one.

If you've never used GitHub before, you can try out the [starter course](https://classroom.github.com/a/w9VOOLL8). On clicking this link you will be asked to pick your identifier (CRSid) in order to join the classroom. Let me know if your id is missing.

Each week I will email you a link to a new exercise. Once you accept the assignment, GitHub will create a repository called `<exercise-name>-<your-username>` in the `Part-II-Computational-Physics` organization on GitHub. Please __change the name of the repo to `<exercise-name>-<CRSid>`__ for ease of marking. Only you and the course admins (the demonstrators and me) can see this repo.

Note that _there is no explicit "submit" button_. You submit your work by making changes to a copy of the repository containing the exercise description. You can make as many changes ("commits") as you like up until the deadline. Note that you can continue to add commits to the repo after the deadline, but only the last commit before the deadline is counted as the submission.

Please use the [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/Part-II-Computational-Physics/discussions) section to ask questions to your demonstrators (about the exercises) and me (about everything else). Treat the discussions as if they are a real life examples class where others can learn from your questions and the answers to them.

If you're using VS Code, there is a [GitHub Classroom extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.classroom) that allows you to view, work on, and submit assignments directly within the editor.

# First exercise: PDEs

The first exercise concerns solving a simple PDE using different methods. Your demonstrator for this exercise is Nathan Magnan, a PhD student from DAMTP.
